  Fix cause of database corruption where object index free list was
  sometimes not written to the database correctly.

  Add "array of" value expression to return a type that represents
  an array of a type. (not in manual yet)

  Add "enum" filter to check if a class is an enum

  Add "serializable" filter

  Fix ambiguity in query parser that would cause parsing some queries
  with Value Expressions (e.g. type of) to fail

  Fix standalone startup when it has never run before.  Instead of
  crashing, or using the default database (which was the previous
  behavior) it will ask for a directory in which to put the initial
  database.

	BBQ for .Net now captures and lets you query information about exception
	catches (not throws though; look for calls to exception class constructors),
	resources included in analyzed assemblies, and annotations.  This new
	functionality is experimental

	It also includes what has proven to be the very convenient "any class" operator.  The set expression 

	any class "classname"

	will return all the classes with that name regardless of the namespace
	they are in.  This is generally much more convenient than typing in the
	complete class name or keeping your import list set properly.

	The cast operator allows you to explicitly specify a type
	for an ambiguously typed expression, which helps build more complex
	expressions.
