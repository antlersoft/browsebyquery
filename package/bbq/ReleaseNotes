bbq0.7.3 --

BBQ for Java now captures and lets you query information about exception
catches (not throws though; look for calls to exception class constructors),
resource bundles included in analyzed jars, and annotations.  All this new
functionality is rather experimental and is (as of 8/17/2009)
not yet documented in the language manual.  Also further additions
to the grammar to query this information are forthcoming.

It also includes what has proven to be the very convenient "any class" operator.  The set expression 

any class "classname"

will return all the classes with that name regardless of the namespace
they are in.  This is generally much more convenient than typing in the
complete class name or keeping your import list set properly.

Finally, the cast operator allows you to explicitly specify a type
for an ambiguously typed expression, which helps build more complex
expressions.
