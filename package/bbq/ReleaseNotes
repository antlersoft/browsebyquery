bbq0.7.9--

  Fix ambiguity in query parser that would cause parsing some queries
  with Value Expressions (e.g. type of) to fail

bbq0.7.8 --

  Fix standalone startup when it has never run before.  Instead of
  crashing, or using the default database (which was the previous
  behavior) it will ask for a directory in which to put the initial
  database.
