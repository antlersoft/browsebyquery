bbq0.5.10

This is a bug-fix release, which fixes some long-standing bugs in the datastore.

The only visible effect of these bugs in BBQ for Java was that some queries by type
(fields with type... or methods with type... ) would return incomplete results.

Because previous versions of the datastore may have created corrupt indices, the
datastore version number has been incremented.  This will mean that your existing
BBQ databases will be cleared.  You will need to re-analyze to populate them (except
for the Eclipse version, which will do this automatically).

Also, the display of stored expressions that contain other stored expressions
in the stored expression list window has been fixed.
