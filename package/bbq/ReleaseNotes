bbq0.7.10 --

  Add "each" value expression (value expression equivalent of "same"); also
  make "same" work like value expression when necessary. (not in manual yet)

  Fix cause of database corruption where object index free list was
  sometimes not written to the database correctly.  Updated allocator
  version in order to force databases to be rebuilt so the problem gets
  cleaned (even though there would otherwise be no problem opening
  existing databases.)

  Add "array of" value expression to return a type that represents
  an array of a type. (not in manual yet)
