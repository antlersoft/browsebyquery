--bbq0.8.0
  Add "selection" keyword to language; change all UI's
  to populate "selection" based on selecting from previous result list.

  Change Eclipse plugin and standalone to make result list multi-select,
  and give select-all and copy options.  Copy copies selected items
  as text to the clipboard.

--bbq0.7.12
  Add way to externalize object keys as strings

  Change how plugin resolves types enclosed in other types
--bbq0.7.10
  Add "each" value expression (value expression equivalent of "same"); also
  make same work like value expression when necessary. (not in manual yet)

  Fix cause of database corruption where object index free list was
  sometimes not written to the database correctly. Increment
  DirectoryAllocator version

  Add "array of" value expression to return a type that represents
  an array of a type. (not in manual yet)

--bbq0.7.9

  Fix ambiguity in query parser that would cause parsing some queries
  with Value Expressions (e.g. type of) to fail

--bbq0.7.8

  Fix standalone startup when it has never run before.  Instead of
  crashing, or using the default database (which was the previous
  behavior) it will ask for a directory in which to put the initial
  database.

--bbq0.7.7

  Fix missing actions for Browse-By-Query menu popup

  Fix ant builds to work with new project layout with git conversion

--bbq0.7.5

--Eclipse plugin enhancements due to Dirk Faulhaber.

--Fix for "all packages" set expression

--Fix for reading class files with parameter annotations (thanks to Larry Edelstein)

--bbq0.7.3

BBQ for Java now captures and lets you query information about exception
catches (not throws though; look for calls to exception class constructors),
resource bundles included in analyzed jars, and annotations.  This new
functionality is experimental

It also includes what has proven to be the very convenient "any class" operator.  The set expression 

any class "classname"

will return all the classes with that name regardless of the namespace
they are in.  This is generally much more convenient than typing in the
complete class name or keeping your import list set properly.

The cast operator allows you to explicitly specify a type
for an ambiguously typed expression, which helps build more complex
expressions.

Grammar summary:

The new language keywords are:

annotations
annotated
any
bundles
cast
catches
names
resources

TypeSpec : methods
TypeSpec : fields
TypeSpec : arguments
TypeSpec : classes
SET_EXPRESSION : all annotations
TRANSFORM : cast TypeSpec
TRANSFORM : annotations of
TRANSFORM : annotations with
TRANSFORM : any class
TRANSFORM : catches of
TRANSFORM : catches in
TRANSFORM : resources containing
TRANSFORM : resources with names
VALUE_EXPRESSION : annotated by
VALUE_EXPRESSION : classes of
VALUE_EXPRESSION : names of
VALUE_EXPRESSION : bundles containing

--bbq0.6.3

Quick fix because 0.6.2 package was missing icons.  Also updated build script
to tag more files with version number.

--bbq0.6.2

Switch Java version to 1.5+; start switching to using generics for type safety

Change database layout to use indexes more and collections less; should be faster and more reliable

Fix rare crash bug

--bbq0.5.10

Fix bug maintaining indices

Fix bug traversing non-unique indices (affects queries on types)

Fix bug displaying save expressions that reference saved expressions

Make recovering from a corrupt database more robust (particularly in Windows
environment)

Update database version

--bbq0.5.9

Regular expression matching

Display saved values in a table; new saved value window in eclipse version

Fix bug clearing saved expressions and imports clearing database

Refactor for bbqil

Update manual

--bbq0.5.4

static filter

Relational expressions (making value expressions useful)

Manual changes, including tutorial examples

--bbq0.5.2

New object types: Type, Argument, Package

Track inner classes

Persist state of the query engine between sessions

Refactor query engine; implement value expressions

User interface changes

Make database detect version changes

Change indexing in the database to make it faster and more robust.

--bbq0.4.2
Set command lets you assign a name to transforms as well as set expressions.

recursive operator for general recursive transforms

Lexer improvements so you don't have to set off parentheses with spaces

Updates to the language manual

--bbq0.3.13
Add eclipse plugin
Update storage engine memory management
Fix bugs in storage engine

--bbq20050721
Added ant build.xml and properties file

Make standalone work with no command line argument, opening a default database in the current directory

Make opening an obsolete database work, although it gets cleared and you have to re-analyze

Add ability to clear (reset) a database at will


--bbq20050601
Initial version
